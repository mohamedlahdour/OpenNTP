Neutron Transport Package with Graphical User Interface

Neutron Transport Package **OpenRSN** (Open Neutron Transport Package from the Radiations and Nuclear Systems Group), is an open-source code written in FORTRAN90 for a pedagogical purpose to solve the steady-state multigroup neutron transport equation using either:

- Collision Probablity Method (CP) in One-Dimensional for Slab, Cylindrical or Spherical geoemtry. 
- Discrete Ordinate Method (:math:`S_{N}`) in One or Two-Dimensional for Cartesian Geometry.
- Method of Characteristics (MOC) in One-Dimensional for Slab Geometry.

The code, including the graphical user interface is developed and maintained by `Mohamed LAHDOUR <https://github.com/mohamedlahdour>`_ (PhD student) and Prof. `Tarek EL BARDOUNI  <https://github.com/tarekbardouni>`_ from `University Abdelmalek Essaadi Tetouan Morocco <http://www.fst.ac.ma/site/>`_ .


**OpenRSN’s main features are:**

* free & open source software with a pedagogical purpose.
* solve the steady-state multigroup neutron transport equation in one, or two spatial dimensions.
* solve the steady-state multigroup neutron transport equation  in a multiplicative medium with isotropic and anisotropic scatternig source.
* simple framework to add and test new algorithms.
* provided with a graphical user interface written in Python programing language which has been developed to simplify the use of **OpenRSN**.
* computed results: :math:`k_{eff}` and fluxes.
